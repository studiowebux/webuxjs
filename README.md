# WebuxJS
This is the framework for Studio Webux Projects

## Installation 
```bash
npm i --save webuxjs
```

## Usage
this module covers a lot of stuffs,

firstly, 
the index.js file is the entry point.
it loads the app/index.js file, that one contains the whole application. Meaning, it will call the modules required by the application, you can update that file like you want.

secondly,
the api/
it contains the application logics

thirdly, 
the rest of the directories are there to support the application.

I will write a more detailled documentation that cover the modules plus the framework.
